# Monte Carlo Simulation for Risk Analysis

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abf41cee-b05b-4886-850a-906faf3bf505)


## Overview
This project implements a **Monte Carlo Simulation** for risk analysis using randomly generated data in **Microsoft Excel**. The simulation evaluates potential risks based on three pricing scenarios:

- **Pessimistic Price** (worst-case scenario)
- **Most Likely Price** (expected scenario)
- **Optimistic Price** (best-case scenario)

By running multiple simulations, this project provides insights into potential outcomes and their probabilities, helping in decision-making under uncertainty.

## Features
- Generates **random pricing data** for risk assessment using Excel formulas and VBA.
- Uses **Monte Carlo simulation** to model different pricing scenarios.
- Calculates **probability distributions** of possible outcomes.
- Visualizes results using **Excel charts and statistical summaries**.

## Installation
To run this project, you need **Microsoft Excel** with **VBA enabled**.

## Usage
1. Download the Excel file from this repository.
2. Open the file in Microsoft Excel.
3. Enable macros if prompted.
4. Modify input parameters (pessimistic, most likely, optimistic prices) in the designated input cells.
5. Click the **Run Simulation** button to execute the Monte Carlo simulation.
6. View the results in the automatically generated charts and tables.

## Example Output
After running the simulation, you will see:
- **Histogram of simulated price distributions**
- **Mean, variance, and probability ranges**
- **Predicted risk exposure based on the probability model**

## Applications
This Monte Carlo simulation can be applied to:
- **Investment risk analysis**
- **Project cost estimation**
- **Market price forecasting**
- **Financial decision-making**
